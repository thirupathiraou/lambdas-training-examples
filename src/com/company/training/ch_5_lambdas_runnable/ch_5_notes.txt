Thread is a lightweight process. Thread consumes less resources to create and exist in the process;thread shares process resources.
The main thread of Java is the thread that is started when the program starts.
The slave thread is created as a result of the main thread.

A thread can programmatically be created by:

1.Implementing the java.lang.Runnable interface.
2.Extending the java.lang.Thread class.
You can create threads by implementing the runnable interface and overriding the run() method.
Then, you can create a thread object and call the start() method.
