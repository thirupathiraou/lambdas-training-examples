Let's try to solve the problem using Java 7 and then Java 8

   List<Student> studentList= Arrays.asList(
                new Student("Kane","Walker",5),
                new Student("Joe","Root",7),
                new Student("Virat","Kohli",3),
                new Student("Steve","Smith",4),
                new Student("Rohit","Sharma",9)
                );
        //1. print all the student firstName
        //2. Sort the list by firstName
        //3. print student names whose lastName starting with "S"
        //4. formulate a map of students with firstName as Key and their grade as Value (K,V)
